The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.

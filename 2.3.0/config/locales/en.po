Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."
